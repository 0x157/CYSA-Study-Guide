# CYSA-Study-Guide

Notes I took to prepare for the CompTIA CySA+ exam (CS1-003 Beta).  I am scheduled to take the exam 12/10/22; I will post whether this preparation was sufficient once I receive my exam results.  In my professional work, I am a DevOps engineer, but my previous experience included building a cybersecurity program from scratch.  I've done extensive studying on cybersecurity in the past, my degree emphasized security; I was in the top 1% on TryHackMe before beginning to study for the CySA+; I have previously attained cyber certifications including Security+ and Azure Security Fundamentals among others that also apply to the domain.

## Post-Test

12/10 - Immediate Reaction: I took the test earlier today and feel pretty good about it now, I finished with plenty of time to spare and didn't ever feel lost on the test.  Honestly, my work experience paired with TryHackMe prepared me better than any other study mechanism I used.  My advice is to know your Linux commands, your cybersecurity acronyms, and be able to explain why any given course of action may be the best way forward.
