# CYSA-Study-Guide

Notes I took to prepare for the CompTIA CySA+ exam (CS1-003 Beta).  I am scheduled to take the exam 12/10/22; I will post whether this preparation was sufficient once I receive my exam results.  In my professional work, I am a DevOps engineer, but my previous experience included building a cybersecurity program from scratch.  I've done extensive studying on cybersecurity in the past, my degree emphasized security; I was in the top 1% on TryHackMe before beginning to study for the CySA+; I have previously attained cyber certifications including Security+ and Azure Security Fundamentals among others that also apply to the domain.
