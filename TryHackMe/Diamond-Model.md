## Introduction

- 4 key features:
	- adversary

- other dimensions:
	- social

## Adversary

- adversary operator = party conducting the attack
- adversary customer = party benefitting from the attack

## Victim

- victim personae = entities being attacked

## Capability

- capability capacity = usable vulnerabilities and exposures

- Type 2 infrastructure = infrastrucutre controlled by intermediary
- service provider = orgs that provide services critical for type 1 or 2 infrastructure

## Event Meta Features

- timestamp = when the event happened
- phase = see Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain
- result 
- direction = victim-to-infrastructure, infrastructure-to-victim, infrastructure-to-infrastructure, adversary-to-infrastructure, intrastructure-to-adversary, bidirectional, unknwon
- methodology = general classification of intrusion
- resources
