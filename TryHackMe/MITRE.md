# MITRE

## Introduction to MITRE

- MITRE = non-profit US corporation focused on cybersecurity research

## Basic Terminology

- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) = threat group or nation-state group that attacks other entities in long campaigns 
	- may use advanced exploits/tactics, but usually don't need them in order to be successful
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) = 
	- Tactics = goal/objective
	- Techniques = how the tactics are achieved
	- Procedures = how the techniques are executed

## ATT&CK Framework

- ATT&CK Framework = collection of common TTPs used by APTs 
- 14 categories each containing techniques for performing the tactic

## CAR Knowledge Base

- CAR = The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository; MITRE-developed analytics on the MITRE adversary model

## MITRE Engage

- framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations
- "Adversary Engagement Approach" accomplished by "Cyber Denial" and "Cyber Deception"
	- cyber denial = prevent adversary ability to conduct operations
	- cyber deception = place misleading artifacts for adversary
- includes resources for getting started with Adversary Engagement Approach
- engage categories:
	- prepare = actions that will lead to desired outcome
	- expose = trigger deception activities
	- affect = negatively impact adversarial operation with your own
	- elicit = observe adversaries and learn their TTPs
	- understand = output of operations

## MITRE D3FEND

- knowledge graph of cyber counters
- Detection, Denial, and Disruption framework empowering network defense

## ATT&CK Emulation Plans

- MITRE ENGENUITY provides CTID, Adversary Emulation Library, and ATT&CK Emulation Plans
- CTID = Center of Threat-Informed Defense; various companies/vendors conducting research to improve cyber defense
