# Chapter 1: Best Practices, Standards, and a Plan of Action

## Defining Cyberspace and Cybersecurity

- Cyberspace = artifacts derived of computers and communications technology as well as their metadata and interactions
- Cybersecurity = all mechanisms used to protect cyberspace and assets; security objectives include preventing compromise of the following: confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
    - the following terms are closely related to cybersecurity:
        - information security = protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information; may include other provisions such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation, and reliability
        - network security = protection of networks and their services from unauthorized modification, destruction, or disclosure; assurance that networks perform their functions as expected.
    - cybersecurity fully encompasses network security and overlaps with information security, though infosec has a heavier emphasis on protection of physical assets
    - in practice, information security and cybersecurity are terms used interchangeably
- Cybersecurity objectives:
    - availability = system is accessible, usable, and/or operational (as applicable) on demand
    - integrity = data has not been changed in any way for any reason without authorization
