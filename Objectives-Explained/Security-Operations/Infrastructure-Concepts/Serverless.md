# Serverless

## Explanation

The goal of serverless is to abstract infrastructure entirely, so functions or jobs are performed in the cloud on demand and charged purely on usage rather than a schedule.  Serverless architecture is very advantageous to companies who have a very wide range of service usage because they only have to pay for cloud services when a customer executes a serverless function.

## Importance

Understanding the infrastructure that you're protecting is massively important- serverless application are especially vulnerable to DDoS attacks, since they are massively scalable the issue isn't about losing availability, it's that the attack will get VERY expensive very fast.

## Example

AWS services like Fargate and Lambda (especially Lambda) are super commonly used in industry
