# System Hardening

## Explanation

Systems hardening refers to all measures taken to secure a system (not just operating systems).  This includes adhering to best practices, having a streamlined process for updating with patches and service packs, and deploying additional measures like firewalls, endpoint protection systems, and enforcing least privilege.

## Importance

The default settings for most operating systems prioritize out-of-the-box functionality over security, this means that security measures need to be activated within the OS and additional measures need to be installed as well.  

## Example

Windows does not encrypt hard drives by default (as of Windows 10), if someone were to gain physical access to the computer then they could read the contents of the drive with special software even without knowing the login information.
