# Vulnerability Assessment Tools

- you don't need to know every tool in detail, just when and how to use each class of tool

## Web Application Scanners

- scan from perspective of outside user
- only scan for vulnerabilities and exploits that have had a plug-in developed and installed
- given the broad usage of web app scanners, it would be useful to be able to develop specialized tests for your specific environment using the scanner's programming language

### OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

- OWASP = Open Web Application Security Project
- ZAP sits between user browser and web app collecting and modifying packets to test app responses

### Burp Suite

- map and analyze web app vulnerabilities
- combines automated and manual testing
- paid version offers greater automation

### Nikto

- focused on SQL and command injection, XSS, and misconfigurations
- CLI utility- no GUI
- fast if you know what you're doing

### Arachni

- speed-focused web scanner
- parallel scanning
- performs "meta-analysis" to reduce false positives
- needs only a target URL to start scanning

## Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanners

- modern scanners can only find vulnerabilities they know about; in order to know about a vulnerability, a plug-in or extension must be built and installed for it; as a scanner learns about tens of thousands of vulnerabilities, it grows to be an enormous size
- understand tradeoffs made between agent-based and server-based and between authenticated and unauthenticated

### Nessus

- created and maintained by Tenable
- 80k+ plug-ins
    - plug-ins are written using Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL)
    - Nessus subscription service offers updated plug-ins daily for vulnerabilities discovered within 24 hours
- can be accessed/controlled from browser
- can be aimed at one or multiple devices specified by IP or IP range with CIDR notation
- offers compliance checks
- details are included on each discovered vulnerability

### OpenVAS

- Open Vulnerability Assessment System = OpenVAS; includes vulnerability identification and management
-
