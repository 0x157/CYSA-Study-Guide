# Vulnerability Management Activities

## Vulnerability Identification

- vulnerability scanning = automation of security checks against org's systems; point out weaknesses in system
  - key aspect of network security
  - single purpose tools, do not analyze context, can't chain exploits (so a bunch of small vulnerabilities that can create a big hole only appear as small vulnerabilities), they don't act like an attacker- they act like an automated system searching for a predetermined list of potential vulnerabilities

### Regulatory Environments

- many organizations are forced to operate under the control of laws, rules, and regulations of governments, industry groups, or other regulatory bodies
- orgs within regulatory environments generally have to deal with compliance in some way, and that compliance often has a security aspect

#### ISO/IEC 27001 Standard

- The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) jointly maintain this standard on Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)
- VERY common voluntary standard
- three stages of certification:
  1. desk-side audit to ensure documentation for vulnerability management
  2. implementation audit to ensure documentation is followed
  3. surveilance audit ensures that implementation is continued

#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
