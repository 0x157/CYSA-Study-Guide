# Threat Intelligence in Support of Organizational Security

## Intro

- alert fatigue = too many false alarms, leading to decrease in responsiveness from incident responders
  - adding more layers of threat intelligence increases context for events and decreases false alarms

## Levels of Intelligence

- security efforts should impair the ability of threat actors to attack or damage the organization
- threat intelligence needs to work to anticipate attacker actions
  - various levels of threat intelligence must exist so as to inform different levels of an organziation's hierarchy to take appropriate actions

| Level | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Strategic | Highest level of intelligence; used to inform organization leaders of key concerns; not overtly technical |
| Operational | Who/when/what are we defending and for how long?  What should be done to achieve strategic goals and what resources do we need? |
| Tactical | Precisely what are the defenders doing in response to actions by attackers; highly actionable level of intel |
